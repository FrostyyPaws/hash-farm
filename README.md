# Intended functionality
Using Node.js, hash a simple string indepedently stored in a local text file. Keep a map of said hash to check against

### SHA
SHA will be used as a baseline to learn from, though not necessarily directly reproduced

### Learning goals
Get more familiar with using bit-level operations to manipulate strings, and with hashing as a whole. 

## This is aimed to be part 1 of a 2-part process. The sequel to this will be moving into encryption/decryption of the same data
