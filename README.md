# Intended functionality
Using Node.js, hash a simple string using solid security principles

### SHA
SHA will be used as a baseline to learn from, but not reproduced

### Learning goals
Get more familiar with cryptography and hashing as a whole. Note this is not intended to be used in production (don't roll your own!).
This is aimed to be part 1 of a 2-part process. The sequel to this will be moving into encryption/decryption of the same data

## THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN PRODUCTION. IT IS A LEARN-BY-DOING PROJECT. NEVER ROLL YOUR OWN!
